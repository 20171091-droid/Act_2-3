        "Be spontaneous fr nothing exciting comes out of a planned trip". <br><br>

        <p>
            hello! Again I am Jonathan Rex D. Biado, I am 21 years old and
            I live in the City of Pines. Something about be is I am very
            spontaneous, and have a free spirit, I like going out doing everything
            that comes to mind, Though it may not look like it but I am very loud
             when you got to know me, honestly even if you dont.  <br><br><br>

            Anyways as I said I am a free spririted person and down to do
            everything. First of all I'll walk you through the things I've done 
            and experienced. so first of all, I do hiking,
            dancing, swimming, archery, table tennis, partying, gaming, sewing,
            crafting, and many more I may take all day if I continue with this.
            Anyways I have 5 dogs and two birds named suni and up, they are kinda mean
             I mean not mean maybe just scared because of the new environment but yeah.
